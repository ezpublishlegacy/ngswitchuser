This module allows ezPublish Admin user (id:14) to switch logged in user in administration interface. 
With it you can: 

- test roles and policies for different user
- see how admin interface behaves for different user

Very useful if you are developing modules that depends on lot of roles and policies.

You can switch between users numerous times and restore originally logged in user.
